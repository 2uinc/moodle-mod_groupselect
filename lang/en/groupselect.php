<p>Lets students create and select groups. Features:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Students can create groups, give them a description and set them password protected, if wanted</li>
<li>Students can select and join groups</li>
<li>Full compatibility with basic Moodle groups: groups may be created by other means if needed, supports group
        assignment submissions etc.</li>
<li>Teacher can export course user list as a csv-file, which shows group data</li>
</ul>

<p>Currently in alpha stage, any feedback would be appreciated! (pirkka dot pyykkonen at tut dot fi)</p>
